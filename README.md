## Cross-browser extension template

#### It's WIP currently

### Introduction
A set of build scripts facilitating cross-browser extensions' development plus dummy sample extension.

### Before you begin
This project aims at developing extensions for several browsers at once and assumes that you need a build step for your scripts. If you target Chromium-based browsers only and do not need scripts compilation, it's worth taking a look at a simpler template here(TODO).

Here's the worldwide browser usage stats: https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide/

Also, please be aware that this template uses `Manifest V2`. Read [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv2-sunset/) and [here](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2021/05/27/manifest-v3-update/) to make your choices.
